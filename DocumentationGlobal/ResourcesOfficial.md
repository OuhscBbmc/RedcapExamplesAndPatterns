# Official Resources for our Software Recommendations
This is a collection of offical and endorsed books, articles, and blogs that I've found helpful establishing up our reporting flow of R, RStudio, kniter, Markdown, and GitHub.  Depending on what you're doing with the reports, you may not need to know some of these parts well.

### REDCap
REDCap is the name of the database system that (1) stores data, (2) provides a webpage interface in & out of the data, and (3) provide a webservice/API in & out of the data.  [Here's](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/RedcapExamplesAndPatterns/blob/master/Publications/Presentation2013-01UserGroup/RedcapForUserGroup.pptx) a presentation we gave at the Feb 2013 [SAS/R User Group meeting](http://dwulab.com/statistics/).
* The **[official REDCap website](http://project-redcap.org/)** has a lot of information.  For REDCap administrators, there's a lot on installation and site settings.  For REDCap project managers, there's a lot on creating new projects and customizing the interface.  Some documentation is written, some is video.  New material is constantly being added, so I'm not going to hard link to any specific page.  If your new to REDCap and creating projects, it's worth spending several hours on this page. {added Feb 2013}
* The **[REDCap Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/project-redcap)** is a place for questions and trouble-shooting posts.  As you contribute to the posts, please consider that you're an OUHSC representative.  Group membership is required, and is granted by and OUHSC employee, not a REDCap official. The OUHSC administrator should go to [this page](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/surveys/?s=dN78HM). {added Feb 2103}
* The **[REDCap Consortium Wiki](https://iwg.devguard.com/trac/redcap/)** is intended for REDCap administrators (not REDCap project managers).  This site distribute the source code and allows people to create support tickets.  Vandy gives only a few people at each campus access to it.  They designed David Bard as the OUHSC representative in Sept 2012. {added Feb 2103}
* There's a lot of good material floating around, and accessible by searching.  We've really liked material posted by [Terri Scott](https://www.ctspedia.org/wiki/pub/CTSpedia/ReproducibleResearchMethodology/REDCap.Day.2011.TerriScott.pdf).  As you're reviewing other people's approaches, keep in mind that (1) it might be incompatible with the other tools you've chosen to surround REDCap, and (2) it might be based on an older/depreciated feature of REDCap. {added Feb 2103}
* If you have permission to the REDCap Consortium Wiki, some API [documentation](https://iwg.devguard.com/trac/redcap/wiki/ApiDocumentation) & [examples](https://iwg.devguard.com/trac/redcap/wiki/ApiExamples) will be more up to date than the API examples that you can get to from our local REDCap instance (look for the API section in the left pane of a project).

### R
There are many books for different aspects and starting points.  Ask David or Will for a recommendation for your specific task and starting points.  Here are some good ones.
* **[Introductory Statistics with R](http://books.google.com/books?id=YI0kT8cuiVUC&source=gbs_book_other_versions)** Peter Dalgaard's second edition is a great starting place for people with some statistical experience (say, two stat classes), but no exposure to R or programming. [Our library has the book's PDF for free]. {added Sept 2012}
* **[Data Manipulation with R](http://books.google.com/books?id=grfuq1twFe4C)** Phil Spector's short book has many of the essential pieces needed to manipulate (but not graph or analyze) data.  The chapters on dates and factors are the best I've read.  [Our library has the book's PDF for free]. {added Sept 2012}
* **[Getting Started with RStudio](http://books.google.com/books?id=KmC-o32qFpQC)** John Verzani's short book probably isn't critical to read, but consider reading it if you don't have any experiences with an IDE (or you don't know what an IDE is). If you already know RStudio, don't get too excited about some exciting topics in the TOC (eg, "Version Control with RStudio", "Report Generation using Sweave"), but the actual text wasn't very useful.  For instance, under "Debugging R Code in RStudio", the only useful phrase is "...RStudio currently doesn't have addition integration with R's debugging tools...." {added Sept 2012}   
* **[Software for Data Analysis](http://books.google.com/books?id=UXneuOIvhEAC)** John Chambers wrote **S**, which is the foundation for R's syntax.  This book is heavy on the programming side (it's light on graphing and never addresses reports).  You don't need to read this for simple reports and analyses.  But consider it as your programming gets deeper on other projects.  [Our library has the book's PDF for free]. {added Sept 2012}  

### git & GitHub
* **[Git Reference](http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html)** is one of serveral good reference sites.   {added Sept 2012}
* **[Merge Conflict Resolution](http://learn.github.com/p/branching.html)**  graphically represents the progress. (hint: extra text gets added to the code file itself that you have to manually resolve and delete.)  {added Sept 2012}
*  **[Version Control with Git book](http://books.google.com/books/about/Version_Control_with_Git.html?id=e9FsGUHjR5sC)** Will has the second edition that you can borrow. {added Sept 2012}
* **[Example of a successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)**  demonstrates the longitudinal progression of a project on Git.  Since only four of us are developing reports, I doubt will have more than two or three branches.  Probably at most just a 'master branch' and one or two 'feature branches'. {added Sept 2012}

### Reporting & Literate Programming
Literate programming describes the approach of using tools to automate the integration of (in our case) statistical analysis and human-readable reports.  Usually, we'll use `knitr` to combine R and Markdown in order to produce HTML files for *internal* reports.  Less often, we'll use `knitr` to combine R and LaTeX to produce PDF files for *external* reports (where the the report cosmetics are more important).  If you're new to this approach, ignore LaTeX and concentrate on Markdown, because it's much simpler to learn, and will be adequate for most of our needs.
* **[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/)** syntax is important to learn, at least shallowly at first.  The site's demos are particularly helpful.  An easy place to start is to create a new Markdown file within RStudio, and slowly build out. {added Sept 2012}
  Here is the knitr [manual](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-manual.pdf), the  [graphics manual](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/yihui/knitr/knitr-graphics.pdf), and upcoming [book](http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781482203530).  Some places in the website are be tricky figuring out which features are available when (1) knitting LaTeX, (2) knitting markdown, or (3) knitting either. {updated July 2013}
* **[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** is a lightweight syntax for html reports that we don't expect outsiders to read. .  A subset of these can be seen if you click the 'MD' button in the RStudio toolbar when and Rmd file is being edited. {added Sept 2012}
* **[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/guides/, especially http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)** is a sophisticatedand complex syntax for publication-quality reports.  Spend time on it only if outsiders are going to read the report.  Make sure something like `MiKTeX` is already installed on your local computer. {added Sept 2012}
* **[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)** is used to convert the formats of different documents.  We'll try again to produce article-quality tables with R, and then convert them to Word.  Our attempt (with a different program) a few years ago created more work than it saved.  {added Sept 2012}

### Graphs
Our internal and external reports should have a lot of graphics.  I'd like to have these as standardized as possible, so new people have fewer things to learn, and the reports' visuals are more consistent. *Grammar of Graphics* is the original book and `ggplot2` is the package that implements it in R.

You probably shouldn't have to read the books for these reports (especially the original) if you're following my patterns.  But it's extremely useful for future analyses you'll do.  Since I started using `ggplot2` two years ago, I've used it for 90% of my new graphs. {updated July 2013}
 * **[ggplot2 documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)** Similar to the documentation on CRAN, but has visual examples.  The package's reference manual is mediocre, mostly because they put more effort into this site with graphic examples of the syntax.  {added Oct 2012}
 * **[ggplot2 0.9.0 transition guide](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/hadley/ggplot2/guide-col.pdf)** explains the new features, which is necessary if you're reading from the 2009 book. {added Sept 2012}
 * **[ggplot2 book](http://books.google.com/books?id=F_hwtlzPXBcC)** is written by the package's author, Hadley Wickham.  [Our library has the book's PDF for free]. {added Sept 2012}
 * Also see the documents mentioned in [ResourcesOpinions.md](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/RedcapExamplesAndPatterns/blob/master/DocumentationGlobal/ResourcesOpinions.md).
